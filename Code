            What is Html?
        </h3>

        <p class="Def">
            <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the <i>standard language</i> used to <em>create and structure the content</em> of web pages.<br><br>It uses a <strong>system of tags and elements to define the structure</strong>, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, which a web browser then interprets to display the content to a user. HTML is often used alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to build complete web pages.

     <h3>What HTML does?</h3>
     <ul >
        <li>Structures content: It tells a browser how to organize content by labeling it as a heading, a paragraph, or a link, for example.</li>
        <li>Creates web page elements: It is used to create all the basic building blocks of a webpage, including text, images, videos, forms, and more.</li>
        <li>Adds metadata: It can include meta information about a webpage, such as its title, which appears in the browser's tab. </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
        How it works?
     </h3>
     <ol >
        <li>Uses tags: HTML uses "tags" which are instructions enclosed in angle brackets, like <p> for a paragraph or <h1> for a main heading.</li>
        <li>Forms elements: Tags usually come in pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag, which enclose the content to create an element. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p>.</li>
        <li>Assembles a page: These elements are nested within each other to form the complete structure of a web page, which starts with an (html)root element. </li>
     </ol>
